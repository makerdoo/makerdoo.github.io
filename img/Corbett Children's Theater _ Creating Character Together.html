								<h1>Nurturing</h1>
                         
								<p>CCT exists for the youth of eastern Multnomah County. Period. It doesn't get any more basic 
								than that.</p>
								<p>CCT is staffed 100% by volunteers who give their time for the benefit of the kids. We strive to 
								provide a safe place for the youth of East County to stretch their wings in all areas of the theatre 
								arts, regardless of who they are or where they come from.</p>
								<p>At CCT we believe every student not only has value, but great value. As a result we work to 
								nurture every young person with a goal of helping each one recognize their potential.
								This also includes working with the youth to help them develop the tools they need to overcome 
								the challenges of life – and the rigors of the theatre are a great place to learn such an important 
								life lesson!</p>
								<p>It is our desire that any young person can find a place at CCT, regardless of their ambitions in 
								the theatre, where they can grow as an individual and become better equipped for the demands 
								of life.</p>
								<p>You see, the theatre is a fun way to learn skills that will serve the individual for life. Things like:</p>
								<ul>
								<li><b>Teamwork -</b> A theatrical production only comes together only when a group of people of 
								varying skills learn to appreciate what the other brings to the table and begins to 
								collaborate.</li>
								<li><b>How to meet a deadline –</b> The curtain rises on time. There are no excuses. In order to 
								make certain this happens youth must learn to prioritize.</li>
								<li><b>Problem Solving -</b> Things go wrong during performances, and it is up to the performers 
								and crew to come up with a way to fix it in such a way that the audience is never aware 
								of it.</li>
								<li><b>To Think Creatively –</b> See above – there is no set way to fix things in the theatre.</li>
								<li><b>To Think Analytically –</b> In order to turn a script in a show the participants must 
								understand what the author intended with each element of the show.</li>
								<li><b>The Value of Hard Work –</b> Memorization, sometimes many pages. Long nights of 
  							    practice are obvious, but this also includes all the technical trades that come together to 
								create a theatre from construction to graphic arts to lighting.</li>
								<li><b>Increased Literacy –</b> In the theatre, youth are challenged to read more than in just about 
								any other discipline and the exposure ranges from things like Dr. Seuss to more serious 
								works such as Flowers for Algernon to classic literature such as Oliver Twist, The 
								Scarlet Pimpernel, and Little Women.</li>
								<li><b>Public Speaking –</b> The practice in public speaking that comes natural as a result of 
								taking a role on stage is invaluable.</li>
							    <li><b>Confidence –</b> The theatre stretches and challenges every participant and as youth make 
								new discoveries about themselves confidence becomes the byproduct.</li>
							</ul>
								<p>The list goes on, but you get the idea.  At CCT we are dedicated to seeing each individual 
								bloom into a productive member of society. Some will go on in the theatre, but some will not.  
								Our alumni now range from theatre professionals to doctors – and we couldn't be more proud of 
								all their accomplishments!</p>

							<h1>Instructing</h1>
		                         <p>The performing arts are about much more than simply perfoming. Portraying character is 
								more than pretending to be the character, it entails 
								understanding why the character would make the choices he or 
								she makes.&nbsp; As such it is an intro to psychology in the 
								same way that learning to dance provides a gateway to a lifetime of coordination and fitness.</p>
								 <p>Likewise, vocal instruction focuses on articulation, breath control, posture and numerous other disciplines that carry a lifetime of benefits including increased confidence, a firm foundation upon which one might be able to engage in public speaking, improved posture, and improved circulation due to more complete oxygenation in the blood stream.</p>

								<h1>Developing</h1>
                         <p>What do theater kids learn? You might be surprised to learn that the primary things kids learn in a children’s theater are life skills like Teamwork, Problem Solving, Focus, and the Ability to Meet Deadlines.  Sure they learn to sing, dance, and act, and those are useful skills, but the ability to think on your feet and confidently face a room full of people are skills that every individual can benefit from.</p>
                         <p>Think of it this way; in the theater a performer is portraying a character who reacts differently from the way they naturally react to the same stimuli and they have to do it with a roomful of people watching them, while knowing the director is evaluating their performance and at the same time that they can see the chaos that is taking place backstage while...</p>

                         <p>... Literacy in the East County.  A theatre arts education gets kids reading! Perhaps your child becomes interested because they love the fantasy of Tom Sawyer, Pippi Longstocking, or Charlette’s Web, but over time they are introduced to Charles Dickens (Oliver!, A Christmas Carol), and Victor Hugo (Les Miserables) or George Orwell (Animal Farm) and in the process they discover that reading is fun and can open new worlds of possibilities to them!</p>
                         <p>At Corbett Children’s Theater we offer multiple opportunities for the kids every year and every show is based on the written word.  Some are based on classic characters from great fiction like Alice in Wonderland, or Wizard of Oz.  Some are plays and musicals that were not adapted from literature, but either way children have the opportunity to discover the fun and wonder…</p>
